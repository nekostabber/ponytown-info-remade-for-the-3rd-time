## dni

- homophobic, transphobic, racist, ableist, discrimination of any kind against any minority, etc.
- proshitters ðŸ¤® y'all make me SICK.
- pedophiles, zoophiles, necrophiles. literally any paraphilic disorder. keep your shit away from me.
- people who think that its okay to change a characters race for any reason other than to draw them to look like you / identify as them. you can't 'fix' a race, twitter lurkers.

## byi

- sometimes i use tonetags / tonal indicators, sometimes i dont.
- idk but stuff like stfu, for example, sorta sounds a bit serious in text and can put me off from wanting to talk to ya, sorry
- i have trouble understanding stuff sometimes
- i have weird behaviours which cause me to maybe move a bit too much in game or to spend a lot of time not moving so i can read whats said in party chat (pls dont be rude abt it as i cant control it!)
- i have meowbahh and tubers93 skins. they're both pretty controversial people, but i made those skins with mostly ironic intent. still, if you don't feel comfortable with it, then you should probably stay away from me.
